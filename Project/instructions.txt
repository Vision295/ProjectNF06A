goal : create a portfolio that solves the issue of maximizing gain while minimizing risks (gain++, risk--)

    -   1st step gather data : (historical info, risks, correlation between options) Excel using Python
    -   2nd step options     : different options in which to invest (ex : stocks, bonds, commodities, ...)
    -   3rd step contraints  : budget, investment (min and max to invest), risk, return 

C : optimization algo def f(contraints) => return (optimal allocation of investment)
Python : input, preferences and contraints and view metrics (graphs)


features :
Python : 1. Read data of the problem from an Excel file. All data should be in one file (use sheets for modularity).
Python : 2. Allow the user to modify their data if needed
C      : 3. Solve the problem using any known algorithm for portfolio optimization
Python : 4. Display the solution to the investor


4. Once a solution (or multiple solutions are obtained using heuristics), display data
analysis about the different solutions (e.g. best option in which one should invest,
etc.). Use your creativity to propose statistical analysis
5. Graphical interfaces in Python are a plus
6. Interactions between the C and Python must be done using files or existing libraries
for the purpose (Ctypes preferably but other libraries are also accepted)
